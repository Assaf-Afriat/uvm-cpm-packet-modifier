1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The Configurable Packet Modifier (CPM) is a configurable hardware block that processes single-beat packets received on a streaming input
interface and produces corresponding packets on a streaming output interface.
Packet processing behavior is controlled via a register interface and includes:
• deterministic, mode-dependent data transformation
• optional packet drop based on opcode
• deterministic internal processing latency
• ready/valid flow control with backpressure
• observable internal status and counters
The CPM is intentionally compact in functionality while exposing realistic behaviors that require disciplined verification methodologies.

================================================================================

1.2 Scope and Non-Goals
In scope Out of scope
• Single-beat packet processing • Multi-beat packets
• Configuration via registers • Packet reordering
• Deterministic pipeline latency (0–2 cycles) • Interrupt generation
• Ready/valid flow control with backpressure • DMA or memory interfaces
• Strict in-order processing • Multiple clock domains
• Status and counters • Error response generation
Any behavior not explicitly defined in this specification shall be considered implementation-defined and must not be relied upon by
the verification environment.

2. Clocking and Reset
Signal Description
clk Single system clock
rst Active-high synchronous reset
Reset behavior
Upon assertion of rst:
• All registers return to reset values
• All internal buffers and pipeline stages are flushed
• All counters are cleared
• The CPM is disabled (CTRL.ENABLE = 0)
• No input packets are accepted
• No output packets are produced
Reset behavior is synchronous to clk. No asynchronous reset behavior is required or expected.

================================================================================
Page 5
================================================================================

3. Packet Definition
Each packet is single-beat and contains the following fields:
id 4 bits Transaction identifier
opcode 4 bits Operation / classification field
payload 16 bits Data payload
There is no packet framing, burst semantics, or multi-cycle packet structure.

================================================================================
Page 6
================================================================================

4. Interface Overview
The CPM exposes three logical interfaces:
Streaming Input Interface Streaming Output Interface Register Control Interface
Verification of the control/register bus protocol itself is out of scope. The control interface shall be assumed functionally correct.

================================================================================
Page 7
================================================================================

5. Streaming Input Interface
5.1 Signals
in_valid Input 1 Input data valid
in_ready Output 1 CPM ready to accept input
in_id Input 4 Packet ID
in_opcode Input 4 Packet opcode
in_payload Input 16 Packet payload
5.2 Handshake Semantics
A packet is accepted when:
in_fire = in_valid && in_ready
Acceptance occurs on the rising edge of clk.
The CPM preserves strict packet ordering under all operating conditions.

================================================================================
Page 8
================================================================================

5.3 Backpressure and Stability Rules
The CPM may deassert in_ready at any time to apply backpressure.
If in_valid == 1 and in_ready == 0, the following signals must remain stable until acceptance:
• in_id
• in_opcode
• in_payload

================================================================================
Page 9
================================================================================

6. Streaming Output Interface
6.1 Signals
out_valid Output 1 Output data valid
out_ready Input 1 Downstream ready
out_id Output 4 Packet ID
out_opcode Output 4 Packet opcode
out_payload Output 16 Packet payload
6.2 Handshake Semantics
A packet is transferred when:
out_fire = out_valid && out_ready
The CPM preserves strict packet ordering between input and output.

================================================================================
Page 10
================================================================================

6.3 Stability Rules
If out_valid == 1 and out_ready == 0, the following signals must remain stable:
• out_id
• out_opcode
• out_payload

================================================================================
Page 11
================================================================================

7. Processing Pipeline and Latency
7.1 Deterministic Latency Model
Packet processing latency is deterministic and depends solely on the configured processing mode.
Latency is defined as the number of cycles between:
• the cycle in which in_fire occurs
• and the earliest cycle in which the corresponding output packet may be presented on the output interface
If out_ready remains asserted, any accepted input packet that is not dropped must result in a valid output packet within at most 2 cycles.
Backpressure on the output interface may delay acceptance beyond the base latency, but the CPM must hold output data stable until accepted.
7.2 Mode-Dependent Behavior
0 PASS payload_out = payload_in 0 cycles
1 XOR payload_out = payload_in ^ MASK 1 cycle
2 ADD payload_out = payload_in + 2 cycles
ADD_CONST
3 ROT payload_out = 1 cycle
rotate_left(payload_in, ROT_AMT)
Mode and parameter values are sampled at input acceptance time (in_fire). Packets already accepted are processed using the configuration values in effect at
their acceptance time.

================================================================================
Page 12
================================================================================

7.3 Ordering Guarantees
Packets are processed strictly in No reordering is permitted Each output packet corresponds
order to a unique previously accepted
input packet, unless dropped

================================================================================
Page 13
================================================================================

8. Drop Functionality
8.1 Drop Condition
A packet is dropped if all of the following are true at input acceptance time (in_fire):
• DROP_CFG.DROP_EN == 1
• in_opcode == DROP_CFG.DROP_OPCODE
8.2 Drop Semantics
When a packet is dropped:
• It is counted as an accepted input packet
• No output packet is produced
• DROPPED_COUNT is incremented
• Dropped packets do not occupy output pipeline stages and do not contribute to output latency
9. Backpressure Behavior
The CPM may temporarily stop accepting input by deasserting in_ready
Backpressure may occur due to internal pipeline occupancy or downstream congestion
Internal buffering is finite
Packet ordering is preserved under all backpressure conditions

================================================================================

================================================================================

10. Register Control Interface
All signals are synchronous to clk. Reset is synchronous via rst.
Signal Direction Description
req Input Request valid
gnt Output Grant / accept request
write_en Input Write enable (1 = write, 0 = read)
addr[7:0] Input Byte address
wdata[31:0] Input Write data
rdata[31:0] Output Read data

================================================================================
Page 15
================================================================================

10.1 Transaction Handshake
A register transaction is considered accepted in any cycle where:
req == 1 && gnt == 1
The CPM does not introduce wait states on the register interface. The signal gnt is asserted whenever req is asserted.
Therefore, a transaction always completes in a single cycle.

================================================================================
Page 16
================================================================================

10.3 Write Transaction Semantics 10.4 Read Transaction Semantics
A write transaction is defined by: A read transaction is defined by:
req == 1 && gnt == 1 && write_en == 1 req == 1 && gnt == 1 && write_en == 0
The addressed register is updated on the rising edge of the clock The value of the addressed register is returned on the signal rdata.
cycle in which the write transaction is accepted.
For the purposes of this project, the master shall sample rdata on
the rising edge of the clock cycle following the acceptance of the
read transaction.

================================================================================
Page 17
================================================================================

10.5 Protocol Scope
The CPM register interface is intended for functional control and configuration only. Protocol-level aspects
such as arbitration, retries, errors, wait states, or bus contention are out of scope and shall not be verified as part
of this project.

================================================================================

================================================================================

10.6 Register Access Semantics
All register writes take effect on the rising edge of clk in which the write transaction completes.
